# Esperanto course at C3 events

Small Esperanto course held and to be held at various c3 events.

As there are quite some parallelisms between the worldwide Esperanto community
and the worldwide hacker scene, there are usually some Esperanto speakers
attending the big Chaos events.  Oftentimes we are two of them.

Of course we cannot give a comprehensive course about Esperanto, but a few
insights to the language and its community first hand.
